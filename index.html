<div class="body-p">
<p class="p text">It's been hectic since I saw you. On the way back I had
two very good days in London, one of which was dedicated to the National Gallery. The main purpose of my
visit was Manet's <em>Execution of Maximilian</em>. Though I have
spent so many hours looking at that image in the studio,
I was still surprised by seeing it in the flesh again: the
the way the painting works at its own scale (I have almost
become habituated to the image at the scale at which I
am drawing it); its fragmentation (which registers more
viscerally in the object itself); the effect of its missing
parts (i.e., we only see the hand of Maximilian; this absence of the figure who would be executed leaves a space
open,to fill ourselves).</p>
</div>
<div class="p-plus-p">
<p class="p text">I also did some grazing on the collection. The surprise in this was Titian's <em>Death of Actaeon</em>, which made
me think of the origins of the <em>Allegory</em> show, the endless
process of self-devouring that is also the Gwion Gwion's
self-generation into the present. I am not sure if you have
ever spent much time with that Titian painting, but part
of what is striking is the different painterly or material
treatment in different parts of the picture. In the section
where Actaeon is turned into a stag to be devoured by
his own hounds (i.e, the right-hand section of the image)
the painting becomes incredibly crude, scarcely more
than paint itself, so that our itinerary towards this scene
of violence is both towards Actaeon (suspended at the
moment before he is) consumed by his own dogs, but
also towards (the suspension of) the moment when figuration is consumed by the matter of the painting. This
was all the more pronounced with Manet's <em>Execution</em> in my like one head, where the firing of a lethal projectilr is figured like one moment endlessly repeated, whith that Manet
coolness: all those soldiers, almost replicas of one
another, seem to perform that same instant, like a Muybridge which does not progress into a representation of
movement, with all the figures that cut out and stacked into one frame. By contrasting Titan's painting has the moment of the arrow being shot, and what follows from that shooting, all within one frame, a series of unfolding events in one picture. The arrow is absent, but the scene races to transform itself ahead  of the protagonist's act of firing to become the materiality of paint, 
towards another kind of devouring, where the picture consumes its scene.
Spending time with the surface of that painting,
that "racing" also slowed down my looking, to the pace
of painting (rather than the speed of firing), or produced
a type of looking that seemed to track the pace of executing a painting.</p></div>
<div class="pp">
<p class="p text">I did have one other moment that reminded me of
our Gwion Gwion conversations while I was away:
a little escape moment from installing in Selestat to
see - for the first time - the Isenheim altarpiece in Colmar. Have you seen it in the flesh? It is extraordinary as
a first-hand experience, for which no number of reproductions fully prepares you. Partly this is to do with the
weirdness of the entire complex, the less well-known
parts of the polyptych, a kind of weird sci-fi Christian
technicolor hallucination. In particular the Resurrectior
is a strange thing. Christ's face is almost obliterated by
its own glow, becoming simply yellowy-orange surface;
his eyes the only feature of his face to fully survive its
own luminosity, strangely giving the impression they
are the seeing eyes of the picture itself rather than of
the face the image woulu bear. The St Anthony picture wonderfully monstrous. Though it is of course the most
familiar on some level, it is the Crucifixion that is the
most deeply shocking, truly affecting, and it was also
the thing that reminded me of our discussion. This was
partly through the stunningly rendered flecks of blood
(and bruising around them) that seem to be proliferating
on Jesus' body. Here the very powerful physicality of the
picture seemed important, the sense of the altarpiece
being painted on a bunch of huge slabs of wood that
hover over and above you. The flecks-with their strong
suggestion of the patterning on a tree (alongside the
tree-like gnarled form of Christ's body)-begin to suggest that Christ's body is both tattooed by the signs of
his torture by his captors, but also marked by the gradual process of his body becoming the very matter of the
image itself. Does this make any sense? The power of the
image-as an illusion of cosmological significance - is
bound up in the strange sense that the very physicality of the picture surface is starting to impose itself on
its own image. A very incoherent set of thoughts, I am
afraid, but in front of that great thing I did feel my experience begin to touch the edge of our conversations.</p></div>

<p class="p text">
Our time at Lake Mungo last month continues to
persist in my mind. I liked what you said the other day
about our time wandering around that extraordinary
landscape. I think you called it a " wind-borne archaeology", and you're right. It's an unstable landscape that
seems to reveal and cover over its histories of inhabitation in a strikingly fluky way. That landscape, the fineness of its constituent matter, has been with me again
the last couple of days. As I think I mentioned when we
met up, I am working this week with Saskia on that trial
wall drawing. We have begun the process of pouncing
(i.e., beating those cartoons,those perforated drawings of the Manet <em>Execution</em> image, with little cheesecloth bags
full of ground charcoal), working on the large wall of my
studio (which by good fortune is almost identical in scale
to that wall at Extra City). It made me think a lot about
charcoal itself, which for me has always been important
to consider as particles. It works by disaggregating as
you draw. Certainly the pouncing we have begun relies
on this characteristic of charcoal. There is something
fascinating about the way those little specks of burnt
wood become airborne, making their way through the
perforations in the cartoons, re-constituting themselves
as a landscape of dots on the wall behind, the surface
beneath the images we were also beginning to un-make
with that pouncing. It will be many days of work to get
it to the density it needs-to fill the wall with the right
accumulation of those charcoaly flecks, the traces of
all those perforations. It's hardly the strange palette of
Lake Mungo, but the sense of a fine matter saturating
the air-its movements at once dispelling and disclosing
the images of another moment we would glimpse-feels
close to what we were within when we walked amongst
those dunes last month.</p></div>

<section class="overlay1" id="allegory">
<p class="pi">A 2010 archeological study found that the prehistoric Gwion Gwion paintings in Australia, whose chromatic vividness contrasts with their age and their exposure to sun and rain, are inhabited by "living pigments". A symbiotic biofilm of red cyanobacteria and black fungi sustains a process of permanent self-painting, while also etching the pictures deeper into the quartz wall. The texts commissioned for the reader respond, from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, to an idiosyncratic temporality and economy - or ecology - of signification. Descending from an inscrutable past to the same extent that they are made now, in radical contemporaneity, the Gwion Gwion are examined as an allegorical metabolism that generates new articulations of “art” and “life”, contamination and purity, prehistory and modernity, bacterial and human colonies, lost knowledge and scientific advancement - collaborative relations between antonyms, altered schemas of “origin” and “identity”.</p>

therianthropes, of baobabs traveling thousands of miles
from Africa to the Australian Kimberley; are they breath-

mineralogical collection of the museum and the diorama
of primitive life; are they witness to and trace of the first
days and nights of soul-making; are they symbioses of

<p class="intro1 text"> Tout <em>s'efface</em>, or everything fades,
yet Blanchot may assist in grasping, and
willing into language, a character before any
signification, an act of production before memory, a
regression groping in the darkness of the cave. Do those
lines demand chronological fixation or attribution, or do
they point to a beyond or a below of art history, where
the first imager turns away from what had been the gesture
before the first image, its object or support, and touches,
intoxicated with the worlds of vision and possibility
that thus open, the boundary that separates image from
non-image, and the human from its antonyms. These
strange images - shadows - call upon us to turn around,
apprehend their pulsating reality: to overcome them, like
a student superseding the master. This is <em>paideia</em>. But it is
also play, the cave painting as feeling and experimenting
"hands," as positive and negative vying for the
same truth. We will return to this.</p></div>

<p class="intro3 text"> Foucault wondering about
a truly socialist governmentality and
Agamben's monastery rule readings, a Rauschenberg
erasure and a gender- and border-crossing with Pasolini,
a genealogy of biopolitics in which fungi consume Freud,
Dawkins is obscured by memes and genes, Thucydides foresees
LOLcats, Bök collaborates with bacteria and Hobbes; the same
but not the same story over and over again, but also a gathering of
these copies and ordering the copies of copies, and a talking about
an ordering of them, an ethnography of delirious replications,
of returns as farce and tragedy, of what does not end and what
does not begin in a copy. These juxtapositions and conceptual
relations, tentative but active in the mind of scholar and the artist
alike, point to other connections between the procedures of the
humanities and conceptual art, a relation that perhaps should
be read through the human, the <em>anthropos</em>, the <em>an-tropical</em>:
without trope, endlessly producing tropes.</p></div>

<p class="past text">No sun was lighted up, the world to view;
No moon did yet her blunted horns renew:
Nor yet was Earth suspended in the sky,
Nor pois'd, did on her own foundations lye:
Nor seas about the shores their arms had thrown;
But earth, and air, and water, were in one.
Thus air was void of light,and earth unstable,
And water's dark abyss unnavigable.
No certain form on any was imprest;
All were confus'd, and each disturb'd the rest.
For hot and cold were in one body fixt;
And soft with hard, and light with heavy mixt.
But God, or Nature, while they thus contend,
To these intestine discords put an end:
Then earth from air, and seas from earth were driv'n,
And grosser air sunk from aetherial Heav'n.
Thus disembroil'd, they take their proper place;
The next of kin, contiguously embrace;
And foes are sunder'd, by a larger space.
The force of fire ascended first on high,
And took its dwelling in the vaulted sky:
Then air succeeds, in lightness next to fire;
Whose atoms from unactive earth retire.
Earth sinks beneath, and draws a num'rous throng
Of pondrous, thick, unwieldy seeds along.
About her coasts, unruly waters roar;
And rising, on a ridge, insult the shore.
And as five zones th' aetherial regions bind,
Five, correspondent, are to Earth assign'd:
The sun with rays, directly darting down, 
Fires all beneath, and fries the middle zone:
The two beneath the distant poles, complain
Of endless winter, and perpetual rain.
Betwixt th' extreams, two happier climates hold
The temper that partakes of hot, and cold.
The fields of liquid air, inclosing all,
Surround the compass of this earthly ball:
The lighter parts lye next the fires above;
The grosser near the watry surface move:
Thick clouds are spread, and storms engender there,
And thunder's voice, which wretched mortals fear,
And winds that on their wings cold winter bear.
Nor were those blustring brethren left at large,
On seas, and shores, their fury to discharge:
Bound as they are, and circumscrib'd in place,
They rend the world, resistless, where they pass;
And mighty marks of mischief leave behind.</p>
